## Inspiration
Modern social media sterilizes and flattens everyone's online image. The same grid template, same post format, it's all very stifling. To us, the best form of online self expression comes in highly customizable and personal websites, however to most it's either too time consuming and expensive to maintain or they lack the technical skills to launch the page.

## What it does
Our page, hearth, solves this by acting as a middle man. We do all of the dirty work so that the end user has a smooth experience. By providing the user easy and free hosting, social media following features, and simplifying the development process with a on platform website builder utilizing a tuned GPT-4 model to generate websites for user specifications, we hope to create a more vibrant internet.

## How we built it
We built hearth's frontend on a stack using svelte and tailwind css. The backend is built on sqlite and express.js. The design page utilizes ChatGPT's API to leverage GPT-4 and monaco as a text editor to allow user customization of the AI generated websites. 

## Challenges we ran into
One big challenge we ran into was the time limitation. Due to the time constraint we were unable to implement every web page and feature we had hoped to. We had to prioritize and ship the features we thought were most critical to hearth's vision.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of our sleek minimal design and the smooth integration our website builder has with ChatGPT.

## What we learned
We learned how to effectively prompt engineer ChatGPT, the backend required to utillize Chat GPT and store user data, and design a clean and user friendly webpage.

## What's next for hearth
We hope to improve our website design page by implementing a market where users can use community components and templates as well as make it more easy for people who are less technical. We were also unable to render svelte in our web page so we used html / css instead for user webpages, that could be another area of improvement.
